Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the stock price for a given stock using historical data. It fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library, trains a Linear Regression model using the stock's closing prices, and then predicts future stock prices for the next 30 days.

The project includes:

Fetching stock data for any stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.)
Preparing the data for machine learning
Training and testing a Linear Regression model
Visualizing historical stock prices and predicted future prices
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas (for data manipulation)
matplotlib (for plotting graphs)
yfinance (for fetching stock data)
scikit-learn (for building and training machine learning models)
